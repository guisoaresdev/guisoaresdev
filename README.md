# Welcome
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gui or Guilherme aka NemesisTh1 if you prefer (I know it's weird to pronunce for non-brazilian people, yeah im from Brazil), im trying to treat this file as what i think it should be, a remote repository to write my story as a developer and use the insights for checking important events and improvements for my own development and for those interested in my work.



## Languages and Technologies: 

Beginner Level
(Note: I should say that this is probably where i find myself in Development. Understanding about 10% of each one of these items. I should say that understanding 10% already helped me a lot get a better understanding about the market that im getting in, the processes, procedures, things are starting to seem easier to grasp, i see more patterns now, i feel a little more excited cuz im starting to feel more like a enginner using tools where are better needed, instead of being the language worshipper that i used to think that we should all become at some point of our careers, maybe for not understanding the purposes of a programming language back then.)
