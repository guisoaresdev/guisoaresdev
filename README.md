# Welcome
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gui or Guilherme if you prefer (I know it's weird to pronunce for non-brazilian people, im from Brazil), im trying to treat this file as what i think it should be, a remote repository to write my story as a developer and use the insights for checking important events and improvements for my own development and for those interested in my work.

:man_student: Im currently studying Software Engineering at the [Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul](https://www.ufms.br/) in Brazil.

## Work Experience:
6 Months Internship in Fullstack Web/Mobile Development using React/NodeJS at [Inside The Box](https://www.linkedin.com/company/insidevarejo/)



## Languages: 

Note: I should say that I nderstand about 10-20% of each one of these languages, which already helped me a lot get a better understanding about the market that im getting in, the processes, procedures, architectures, things are starting to seem easier to grasp, i see more patterns now, i feel more excited now since i could start making my own projects (im starting to feel like a enginner using tools where are better needed, instead of being the language worshipper that i used to think that we should all become at some point of our careers, maybe for not understanding the purposes of a programming language back then).
